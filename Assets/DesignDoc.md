# FebJam - Tower Defense

## Key game ideas:
- Defend a tower
- 3D
- FPS or TPS? Need to playtest
  - Probably want FPS to get a sort of "fast paced" shooter style
  - Need to make sure that it's still understandable and playable. Minimap?
- Upgrades / level ups
  - Player upgrades
    - Damage up
    - Speed up
    - Armor
    - etc.
  - Tower upgrades
    - Spikes
    - Walls (maze sorta stuff)
    - Defenses in the tower itself
- Few key weapons to defend with
  - Bow (precise)
  - Machete / knife (melee)
  - Chain gun (fast)
  - Launcher (aoe)
- Camera slowly backs out while playing harder levels
